          A whopping 91% of plastic isn't recycled. Billions of tons of plastic
          have been made over the past decades, and much of it is becoming trash
          and litter.

          But how did we get here?

                Mass production of plastics, which began just six decades ago,
                has accelerated so rapidly that it has created 8.3 billion
                metric tons—most of it in disposable products that end up as
                trash.

                Of the 8.3 billion metric tons that has been produced, 6.3
                billion metric tons has become plastic waste. Of that, only nine
                percent has been recycled. The vast majority—79 percent—is
                accumulating in landfills or sloughing off in the natural
                environment as litter. Meaning: at some point, much of it ends
                up in the oceans, the final sink.

                A recent study found that the amount of plastic trash that flows
                into the oceans annually. That research, published in 2015,
                estimated that 8 million metric tons of plastic ends up in the
                oceans every year. That is the equivalent to five grocery bags
                of plastic trash for every foot of coastline around the globe.
